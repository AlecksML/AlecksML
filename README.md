# Context
This dataset was collected by (Anton Bobanov) from car sale advertisements for study/practice purposes in 2016. Though there is couple well known car features datasets. But I wanted to practice with real raw data which has all inconvenient moments (as NA’s for example).

This dataset contains data for more than 9.5K cars sale in Ukraine. Most of them are used cars so it opens the possibility to analyze features related to car operation.

# Content
