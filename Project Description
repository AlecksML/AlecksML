# Description
Machine Learning Project.

The goal of this project is to predict the price of cars using Machine Learning Regression models. The algorithms that are used here to determine the prices of the cars are Linear Regression, SVR, Decision trees, RandomForest regressor, ExtraTreesRegressor, AdaBoostRegressor, GradientBoosting regressor. Where after data cleaning and some tweaking a LinearRegression model scores higher on the test samples

This dataset was collected by (Anton Bobanov) from car sale advertisements for study/practice purposes in 2016. Though there is couple well known car features datasets, This dataset is extremely beneficial for study practice purposes.

The dataset contains data for more than 9.5K cars sale in Ukraine. Most of them are used cars so it opens the possibility to analyze features related to car operation.

# Content
Dataset contains 9576 rows and 10 variables with essential meanings:
* car: manufacturer brand
*	price: seller’s price in advertisement (in USD)
*	body: car body type
*	mileage: as mentioned in advertisement (‘000 Km)
*	engV: rounded engine volume (‘000 cubic cm)
*	engType: type of fuel (“Other” in this case should be treated as NA)
*	registration: whether car registered in Ukraine or not
*	year: year of production
*	model: specific model name
*	drive: drive type
